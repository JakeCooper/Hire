Good Morning is an app backed by \textit{SoftStart}. The app will help users wake up in the morning using a personal assistant, machine learning, and smart integrations. Despite a number of other apps in this domain, we believe that Good Morning will provide users with a wake up experience currently not available in other applications. The objectives for Good Morning are

\begin{description}
  \item[An Alarm] Core alarm functionality or similar to wake the user up gracefully.
  \item[A Smart Assistant] A personal assistant to help take you from waking up, through your morning routine and out the door.
  \item[Machine Learning] Support for learning the users morning routine and assisting them in adjusting their schedule and wake up time accordingly.
  \item[Smart Integrations] Connection to smart devices around the house (e.g. a \gls{philipsHue}) to help the user throughout their morning routine.
\end{description}

\textit{SoftStart} is excited to start developing the requirements for Good Morning with your organization. We look forward to hearing from you!

% INTRODUCTION
% ---------------------------------------
\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Here at \textit{SoftStart} software incubator we make great ideas happen.
Good Morning is an app that will help users wake up in the
morning. It will help them get the most out of their morning routine with a personal assistant. In addition, it will use machine learning and smart integrations to make their morning the best it can be. More information about the problem and objective can be found in sections \ref{problem-description} and \ref{project-objectives} respectively.

% TODO: BEN - Current Systems intro

Good Morning will focus on young adults and young professionals. Users who are interested in increasing their productivity and organization and are familiar with technology for day-to-day use (see section \ref{target-users}). Many of these users may already have smart, internet of things, devices in the household. Good Morning will integrate with these devices to provide further support during the morning routine. Possible integrations are discussed further in section \ref{known-interactions}.

A significant constraint for Good Morning will be internationalization. Because of the integrated nature of Good Morning there will be issues around cultural norms as well as the personal assistant. See section \ref{known-constraints} for more information on constraints.

%
% PROBLEM DEFINITION
% ---------------------------------------
\section{Problem Description}\label{problem-description}

Our market research shows that over 80\% of our users find the morning to be the most difficult portion of their day \cite{marketResearch}. With such an overwhelming majority of the population having trouble in the morning it is obvious there needs to be a smarter and more intuitive way to get yourself up in the morning.

This is the market that we hope to tap with our application. By making an application that boasts an easy way to get up and access your information in the morning we will be able to easily acquire and process information on this important portion of our users day and use this to help others to wake up faster and easier.

%
% PROJECT OBJECTIVES
% ---------------------------------------
\section{Project Objectives}\label{project-objectives}

There are several key objectives that make up Good Morning,

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Deliver a system that reliably wakes the user up.
\item
  Deliver additional information to improve the process of waking up, such as Weather, Missed Messages etc.
\item
  A flexible system that can adapt to changes in your schedule.
\item
  Integration with additional smart technologies, e.g. a \glslink{philipsHue}{Philips Hue wakeup light}
\end{itemize}

% TODO: JAKE - Project Objectives

%
% CURRENT SYSTEMS
% ---------------------------------------
\section{Current Systems}\label{current-systems}

\textit{SoftStart} believes that Good Morning has the potential to fill a sizeable market niche that is currently vacant. There are currently no other all-in-one systems for boosting morning productivity. However, some other applications on the market provide similar tools and functionality.

There are some wake up applications currently on the market, most of which are variations of alarm clocks. The following are a few of the more popular and unique ones that are in use:

\begin{itemize}
\item
    \textbf{Sleep Cycle}: Sleep cycle is a simple alarm clock that monitors your sleep cycle, and wakes you up during the lightest part of your sleep.
\item
    \textbf{iCuckoo}: This alarm application makes a donation to a charity of your choice every time you hit the snooze button.
\item
    \textbf{Wakie}: Wakie is a different but unique approach to waking up. It involves two anonymous users. Users are either wakies or sleepyheads. The sleepyheads determine what time they would like to wake up and how they would like to be woken up. Then the wakies will contact them at the specified time and discuss whatever topic the sleepyhead specified. The wakies only have 1 minute to wake the sleepyhead up.
\item
	\textbf{Google Now}: Google Now provides users with information based on their current location, frequently visited locations, and search history. It provides a lot of useful and relevant information to users that changes with the time of day.
\end{itemize}

Good Morning will provide users with many of the tools that the above applications provide, but package them all together with an easy to use interface. On top of that, it will also interact with other smart system, giving users extended flexibility and functionality. No other system provides such comprehensive features as Good Morning.

% TARGET USERS
% ---------------------------------------
\section{Target Users}\label{target-users}

Good Morning targets the age group of 18 to 32 because this age group is statistically the most likely to suffer from sleep issues \cite{sleepdisorders}. Furthermore, this age group is extremely busy and high stress, and Good Morning can help by cognitively offloading all of the stress of morning planning. This group of users can benefit greatly from Good Morning technology to improve their morning routine, which affects the rest of their day.

By utilizing the Good Morning application, this demographic of users will be able to improve all aspects of their life by waking up pleasantly and comfortably.
% TODO: JAKE - Target Users

%
% KNOWN INTERACTIONS
% ---------------------------------------
\section{Known Interactions}\label{known-interactions}

One of the most important portions of this application will be how it interacts with the world around our users. For this reason we expect the implementation to have a easily extensible \gls{api} so that it can be used with \gls{iot} devices (listed below).

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \gls{philipsHue}
\item
  Pepple Smart Watch
\item
  Apple Watch
\end{itemize}

We also expect the application to be written so we can have multiple front ends.
\begin{itemize}
\item
  iOS
\item
  Android
\item
  Responsive Web Based interface (HTML, Javascript, CSS)
\end{itemize}

There will also have to be extensive communication with a server for machine learning applications. This will require data to be collected throughout the application and for that data to be sent to the server from many sources including.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Calendars (Google, Outlook, Apple)
\item
  Email (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo)
\item
  Weather (The Weather Network \cite{theWeatherNetwork})
\end{itemize}


%
% Known Contraints
% ---------------------------------------
\section{Known Constraints}\label{known-constraints}

The following constraints should be taken into consideration during development.

\begin{itemize}
 \item The app must be available on a variety of mobile platforms, specifically iOS and Android.
 \item Prototype must be completed by the end of March
 \item Must be available and useable internationally and provide mulitlanguage support
 \item Must be capable of interacting with other smart technology
\end{itemize}

% Project Schedule
% ---------------------------------------
\section{Project Schedule}\label{project-schedule}

The requirements for Good Morning will be developed according to a rapid iteration schedule with the final prototype being completed on March 31st, 2016. The full project schedule is show in table \ref{tab:schedule}.
