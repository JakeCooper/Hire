Good Morning is an app backed by \textit{SoftStart}. The app will help users wake up in the morning using a personal assistant, machine learning and smart integrations. Despite a number of other apps in this domain we believe that \textbf{Good Morning} will provide users with a wake up experience currently not available in other applications. The objectives for \textbf{Good Morning} are,

\begin{description}
  \item[An Alarm] Core alarm functionality or similar to wake the user up gracefully.
  \item[Smart Assistant] A personal assistant to help take you from waking up, through your morning routine and out the door.
  \item[Machine Learning] Support for learning the users morning routine and assisting them in adjusting their schedule and wake up time accordingly.
  \item[Smart Integration] Connection to smart devices around the house (e.g. a \gls{philipsHue}) to help the user throughout their morning routine.
\end{description}

\textit{SoftStart} is excited to start developing the requirements for \textbf{Good Morning} with your organization. We look forward to hearing from you!

% INTRODUCTION
% ---------------------------------------
\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Here at \textit{SoftStart} software incubator we make great ideas happen.
\textbf{Good Morning} is an app that will help users wake up in the
morning. It will help them get the most out of their morning routine with a personal assistant. In addition it will use machine learning and smart integrations to make their morning the best it can be. More information about the problem and objective can be found in sections \ref{problem-description} and \ref{project-objectives} respectively.

% TODO: BEN - Current Systems intro

\textbf{Good Morning} will focus on the young adults and young professionals. Users who are interested in increasing their productivity and organization and are familiar with technology for day-to-day use (see section \ref{target-users}). Many of these users may already have smart, internet of things, devices in the household. \textbf{Good Morning} will integrate with these devices to provide further support during the morning routine. Possible integrations are discussed further in section \ref{known-interactions}.

A significant constraint for \textbf{Good Morning} will be internationalization. Because of the integrated nature of \textbf{Good Morning} there will be issues around cultural norms as well as the personal assistant. See section \ref{known-constraints} for more information on constraints.

% PROBLEM DEFINITION

\section{Problem Description}\label{problem-description}

% PROJECT OBJECTIVES
% ---------------------------------------
\section{Project Objectives}\label{project-objectives}

There are several key objectives that make up \textbf{Good Morning},

\begin{itemize}
\item
  A core alarm application
\item
  A smart assistant to tell you Weather, Missed Messages etc.
\item
  Flexibility to learn/integrate your morning schedule
\item
  Smart integration, e.g. a \glslink{philipsHue}{Philips Hue wakeup light}
\end{itemize}

% TODO: JAKE - Project Objectives

% CURRENT SYSTEMS
% ---------------------------------------
\section{Current Systems}\label{current-systems}

Softstart believes that \textbf{Good Morning} has the potential to fill
a sizeable market niche that is currently vacant. There are currently no other all-in-one systems
for boosting morning productivity. There are however some other applications
on the market that provide similar tools and functions.

Wake Up Applications: There are many different wake up applications on the market, most
of which are simple alarm clocks, the following are a few of the more popular and unique ones in use.
\begin{itemize}
\item
    \textbf{Sleep Cycle}: Sleep cycle is a simple alarm clock that monitors your sleep
    cycle, and wakes you up during the lightest part of your sleep.
\item
    \textbf{iCuckoo}: This alarm application makes a donation to a charity of your choice every time you hit the
    the snooze button.
\item
    \textbf{Wakie}: Wakie is a different but unique approach to waking up. It
    involves two anonymous users. Users are either wakies or sleepyheads. 
    The sleepyheads determine what time they would like to wake up and how they would
    like to be woken up. Then the wakies will contact them at the specified time and 
    discuss whatever topic the sleepyhead specified. The wakies only have 1 minute to wake the sleepyhead up.
\item
	\textbf{Google Now}: Google Now provides useful information based on your current location, frequently
	visited locations, and search history. It provides a lot of useful and relevant information to users 
	depending on the time of day.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Good Morning} will provide users with many of the tools that the above applications
provide, but package them all together with an easy to use interface. On top of that, it will also
interact with other systems through the internet of things, allowing users to have even more flexibility 
and utility. No other applications have achieved this yet

% TARGET USERS
% ---------------------------------------
\section{Target Users}\label{target-users}

The target audience will be adults ages 18 -- 32. They will use it as a
personal organization tool.
