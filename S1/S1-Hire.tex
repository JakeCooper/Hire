% INTRODUCTION
% ---------------------------------------
\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

% S1 must address the client RFP2 (C0)
% ├── This should explain what you are going to do for your project as
% │   opposed to how you will accomplish it.
% ├── When writing this, do not assume that your customer has any deep
% │   knowledge of computer science.
% └── Cost estimation is not required.

% TODO: Introduction (Ben)

%
% FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATIONS
% ---------------------------------------
\section{Functional Specification}\label{functional-spec}

% Functional specifications
% ├── The functional specification should include a title page having
% │   the title of your project; the name of your group or company
% │   (which you can invent); the people who contributed to the
% │   document, including authors of individual sections and editor of
% │   the whole paper (e.g., outside consultants); and the date.
% ├── In about two pages you should summarize the project you are
% │   working on.
% ├── Give your system a name and describe what it does and who will use
% │   it.
% ├── What needs and objectives will the project satisfy?
% ├── How will it help the users?
% ├── Outline the most important features of your system.
% └── Describe the hardware your system will use, and any important
%     performance goals that it should satisfy (e.g., time or space
%     efficiency, security, or reliability).

% USER INTERACTION
% ---------------------------------------
\section{User Interaction}\label{user-interaction}
% ├── The next section of about seven or eight pages concerns the user
% │   interaction and will form the basis of your user manual to be
% │   delivered towards the end of the course.
% ├── It should describe the function that the system will perform from
% │   the point of view of the user. Cover the kinds of inputs your
% │   system expects, the actions it will take on both expected and
% │   unexpected input data; the types of outputs the user will see in
% │   those cases. Marks will be deducted for a poor user interface
% │   regardless of the opinion of the customers.
% ├── Include several sample transcripts of the interaction with your
% │   system in the form of a dialogue.
% ├── Include a glossary of all specialized terms used in the document,
% │   either computer science terms that the programmer may not know, or
% │   terms from the field in which you are working.
% └── Context and situation awareness.

%
% MANAGEMENT PLAN
% ---------------------------------------
\section{Management Plan}\label{management-plan}
% ├── The management plan of about five pages should include a breakdown
% │   of the different features of the project, the major classes of
% │   functions and the relationship between them.
% ├── It should also include a page or so discussing possible
% │   implementations.
% ├── Make sure that you do not give the impression that you are
% │   promising more than you intend to deliver.
% ├── Cover yourself by including a page on a minimal system that you
% │   think you can complete by the end of term, and the enhancements
% │   you could include if all goes well.
% └── Finish with a summary restating the main points you want the
%     customer to remember, then include a page on the structure of your
%     team and who will be responsible for which parts of the project.
