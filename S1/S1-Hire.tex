% INTRODUCTION
% ---------------------------------------
\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

% S1 must address the client RFP2 (C0)
% ├── This should explain what you are going to do for your project as
% │   opposed to how you will accomplish it.
% ├── When writing this, do not assume that your customer has any deep
% │   knowledge of computer science.
% └── Cost estimation is not required.

% TODO: Introduction (Ben)

% FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATIONS
% ---------------------------------------
\section{Functional Specification}\label{functional-spec}

% Functional specifications
% ├── The functional specification should include a title page having
% │   the title of your project; the name of your group or company
% │   (which you can invent); the people who contributed to the
% │   document, including authors of individual sections and editor of
% │   the whole paper (e.g., outside consultants); and the date.
% ├── In about two pages you should summarize the project you are
% │   working on.
% ├── Give your system a name and describe what it does and who will use
% │   it.
% ├── What needs and objectives will the project satisfy?
% ├── How will it help the users?
% ├── Outline the most important features of your system.
% └── Describe the hardware your system will use, and any important
%     performance goals that it should satisfy (e.g., time or space
%     efficiency, security, or reliability).

\subsection{Market Position}

Our research has shown there are many competing applications in this market including AirTasker \cite{AirTasker}, Task Rabbit \cite{TaskRabbit}, and ThumbTack \cite{ThumbTack}. 
Because of this pre-existing competition, we are putting a large amount of effort into finding where our application will be competitve against the current solutions. 
Our application will focus on the two areas that we feel need the most improvement; monetization and task screening.

The first area is monetization, many of the currently competing applications take 10\% of each sale. 
We feel 10\% is much too large of a chunk of the transaction and will lower this just 5\% of the transaction. 
This will help us to break into the market quickly as the people working for other task apps will see immediate increases in their profits when they are hired using our applicaition

We will also focus on making the payment process as simple and straight forward as possible. 
There will be no cash involved during the Hire process and all money that is exchanged will be handled securely through our application.

The second area is the lack of proper screening of job requests. 
The mis-classification of job requests is often stated as the largest downfall of task based hiring applications \cite{ThumbTack_sucks}. 
Our team will focus on classifying incoming requests into the appropriate category so our clients and our users will know exactly what is requested before a Hire is made.

\subsection{Technical Requirements}

% TODO: Technical Requirements (Jake)

%
% USER INTERACTION
% ---------------------------------------
\section{User Interaction}\label{user-interaction}
% ├── The next section of about seven or eight pages concerns the user
% │   interaction and will form the basis of your user manual to be
% │   delivered towards the end of the course.
% ├── It should describe the function that the system will perform from
% │   the point of view of the user. Cover the kinds of inputs your
% │   system expects, the actions it will take on both expected and
% │   unexpected input data; the types of outputs the user will see in
% │   those cases. Marks will be deducted for a poor user interface
% │   regardless of the opinion of the customers.
% ├── Include several sample transcripts of the interaction with your
% │   system in the form of a dialogue.
% ├── Include a glossary of all specialized terms used in the document,
% │   either computer science terms that the programmer may not know, or
% │   terms from the field in which you are working.
% └── Context and situation awareness.

%
% MANAGEMENT PLAN
% ---------------------------------------
\section{Management Plan}\label{management-plan}
% ├── The management plan of about five pages should include a breakdown
% │   of the different features of the project, the major classes of
% │   functions and the relationship between them.
% ├── It should also include a page or so discussing possible
% │   implementations.
% ├── Make sure that you do not give the impression that you are
% │   promising more than you intend to deliver.
% ├── Cover yourself by including a page on a minimal system that you
% │   think you can complete by the end of term, and the enhancements
% │   you could include if all goes well.
% └── Finish with a summary restating the main points you want the
%     customer to remember, then include a page on the structure of your
%     team and who will be responsible for which parts of the project.

\subsection{Implementation}

Our technology stack will be organized into a client server model. 
Connections will be initiated through a frontend (either Android or IOS) and requests will be handled by a server written in Scala \cite{scala}. 

This server will be securely hosted by Digital Ocean and will be implemented with horizontal scaling as a top priority. This means that instead of moving our server to a more powerful machine as we get more traffic, we will simply add more machines and split the load between them.

The final piece will be handling monetary transactions, which will be completed using thethe PayPal REST API \cite{paypal}. Using a mature service like PayPal will ensure that monetary transactions are fast secure and simple.
